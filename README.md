# picom-config
My picom config for alacritty and specific applications.
Deleted most of the stuff because most people will not use it and it gives a cleaner look.

99% settings doesn't have any effect on your pc/laptop performance.
Added performance blur, fading, rounded corners and bcakground shadow.
